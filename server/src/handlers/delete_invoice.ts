export async function deleteInvoice(id: number): Promise<boolean> {
    // This is a placeholder declaration! Real code should be implemented here.
    // The goal of this handler is deleting an invoice and all its associated line items.
    // Steps to implement:
    // 1. Delete the invoice by ID (cascade delete will handle line items due to FK constraint)
    // 2. Return true if deletion was successful, false otherwise
    
    return Promise.resolve(true); // Placeholder success response
